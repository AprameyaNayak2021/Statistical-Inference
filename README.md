README: Exponential Distribution and Central Limit Theorem in R

## Author: Aprameya Nayak

## Project Overview
This project investigates the exponential distribution using R and compares it to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Specifically, the study examines the distribution of the averages of 40 exponentials over 1000 simulations and compares the sample mean and variance to the theoretical values. Additionally, the project explores the normality of the distribution of sample means and compares it to a distribution of random uniform numbers. The second part of the project involves analyzing the ToothGrowth dataset available in R, using hypothesis tests and confidence intervals to compare tooth growth by supplement type and dosage.

## Goals
1. **Exponential Distribution Simulation**:
   - Illustrate the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.
   - Compare the sample mean and variance to their theoretical counterparts.
   - Show the approximate normality of the sample mean distribution as predicted by the CLT.

2. **ToothGrowth Data Analysis**:
   - Perform basic exploratory data analysis on the ToothGrowth dataset.
   - Use hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to compare tooth growth across supplement types and dosage levels.
   - Draw conclusions based on statistical techniques taught in class.
